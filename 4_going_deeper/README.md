# Going Deeper

I've glossed-over a lot of the details of how Elm works in order to focus on the particular parts I found most-difficult to grasp. There are many excellent resources to fill in the gaps and make you a well-rounded Elm coder.

I got started with Elm by going through the video tutorials from [Pragmatic Studio](https://pragmaticstudio.com/) and I can't recommend them highly-enough. They're paid resources, but well worth it IMHO. Work through them both.

- [Elm: Building Reactive Web Apps](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elm)
- [Elm: Signals, Mailboxes and Ports](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elm-signals)

Alan Gardner at [CultivateHQ](http://www.cultivatehq.com) has a terrific blog series about integrating the [Phoenix web framework](http://www.cultivatehq.com/posts/phoenix-elm-1/) with Elm. Even if you're not interested in Phoenix (though I certainly am!), it's a great on-ramp to Elm as well.

The [Elm docs](http://elm-lang.org/docs) are a delight to read and go into exhaustive detail on what's available in all aspects of the language. Go here to find specifics on anything in the language.

The [Elm Architecture Tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial) digs more into the details of how the model-update-view flow works, including making ajax calls with the [elm-http](https://github.com/evancz/elm-http) library. It is the definitive location for understanding the MUV approach, but some of it goes a bit quickly, which is why I created this repo as a sort of "pre-requisite".

Enjoy Elm!
