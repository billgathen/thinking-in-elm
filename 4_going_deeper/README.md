# Going Deeper

I've glossed-over a lot of the details of how Elm works in order to focus on the particular parts I found most-difficult to grasp. There are many excellent resources to fill in the gaps and make you a well-rounded Elm coder.

The [Try Elm](http://elm-lang.org/try) app has a link to dozens of examples focused on specific tasks you might want to accomplish with Elm: spend some time wandering through them and have fun fiddling with the code in the online editor.

I got started with Elm by going through the video tutorials from [Pragmatic Studio](https://pragmaticstudio.com/) and I can't recommend them highly-enough. They're paid resources, but well worth it IMHO. Work through them both.

- [Elm: Building Reactive Web Apps](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elm)
- [Elm: Signals, Mailboxes and Ports](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elm-signals)

Alan Gardner at [CultivateHQ](http://www.cultivatehq.com) has a [terrific blog series](http://www.cultivatehq.com/posts/phoenix-elm-1/) about integrating the [Phoenix web framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) with Elm. Even if you're not interested in Phoenix and Elixir (though I certainly am!), it's a great on-ramp to Elm as well.

The [Elm docs](http://elm-lang.org/docs) are a delight to read and go into exhaustive detail on what's available in all aspects of the language. Go here to find specifics on anything in the language.

The [Elm Architecture Tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial) digs more into the details of how the model-update-view flow works, including making ajax calls with the [elm-http](https://github.com/evancz/elm-http) library. It is the definitive location for understanding the MUV approach, but some of it goes a bit quickly, which is why I created this repo as a sort of prerequisite.

For some audio/visual inspiration, Evan Czaplicki and Richard Feldman have done presentations and guested on podcasts discussing Elm. Spend an afternoon going through them to get fired-up about the possibilities of Elm:

- [Changelog 191 - "Elm and Functional Programming with Richard Feldman"](https://changelog.com/191/)
- [Richard Feldman - "Effects as Data"](https://youtu.be/6EdXaWfoslc?list=PLkRkpi23D7EWvlUhLqzeA1BWOEs6x9DMZ)
- [Richard Feldman - "Make the Back-End Team Jealous: Elm in Production"](https://youtu.be/FV0DXNB94NE?list=PLAABP4LiVkD26dSQakyQLe4_a1WUh37uW)
- [Evan Czaplicki - "Let's be mainstream! User focused design in Elm"](https://youtu.be/oYk8CKH7OhE?list=PLjwsJzdHncC6SZrRJ7D8z2v5WJZKk8TuK)
- [Ruby Rogues 212 - "RR Elm with Richard Feldman and Evan Czaplicki"](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/212-rr-elm-with-richard-feldman-and-evan-czaplicki)
- [JavaScript Jabber 175 - "JSJ Elm with Evan Czaplicki and Richard Feldman"](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/175-jsj-elm-with-evan-czaplicki-and-richard-feldman)

And of course, following [Evan Czaplicki](@czaplic), [Richard Feldman](@rtfeldman) and the [Elm-lang](@elmlang) twitter feeds will keep you Elm-inspired on a daily basis. :)

Enjoy Elm!
