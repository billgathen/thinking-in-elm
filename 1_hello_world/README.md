# Hello World

This is an example of the simplest [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) application. We use JavaScript to embed it in a normal HTML page and it displays "Hello World".

The [Main.elm](Main.elm) file is our Elm code. To compile it to JavaScript, run the following command in the terminal: `elm make Main.elm --output elm.js`.

Our code compiles down into plain JavaScript that will run in any browser. It's pulled in to the [index.html](index.html) file and embedded in a manner that will be familiar to anyone who's used [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
